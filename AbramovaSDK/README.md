# Cartoon Chuck`s journey
Author Abramova Irina

***This cartoon was made of absolutely unsuitable objects which were done while procedure studying.
So I think, it to be more arthouse rather than classic.***

## Annotation

*The main character this little story - yellow bird, called Chuck.
He rides a skateboard watching all around at ease.
Than he travels down the river, been surrounded by very picturesque pink mountains.
At the end, following traditional behavior of Angry Birds, he flies.
But does small  harm  as usual.*
